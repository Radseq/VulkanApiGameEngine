# C++ Vulkan Game Engine 

This is my Vulkan Engine just to increase my skill, knowledge and learn more about 3D. and for my satisfaction

Code is mostly written by my own.
Some part might be copied form many sources.

I have used Vulkan 1.2.154.1(07-Oct-2020), Vulkan-Hpp and some features of C++11/14/17/20
, for now to use only in Windows platform

##Note:
I Am not focused on abstraction and great written code, goal is to make stuff working,
i thinking to make many shaders and pipelines just of entity properties because not all entity must use specular lighting or some bloom effect.
Terrain and SkySphere is take form SaschaWillems Tutorial.
For now entity has 
Per-Pixel Lighting
Specular Lighting


List of Source that i used:
* [SaschaWillems](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan)
* [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)
* [jherico fork of SaschaWillems](https://github.com/jherico/vulkan)
