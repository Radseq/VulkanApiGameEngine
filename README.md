# C++ Vulkan Game Engine 

This is my Vulkan Engine just to increase my skill, knowledge and learn more about 3D, and for my satisfaction

Code is mostly written by my own.<br />
Some part might be copied form many sources.

I have used Vulkan 1.2.154.1(07-Oct-2020), Vulkan-Hpp and some features of C++11/14/17/20, <br />
for now to use only in Windows platform

#### Note:
I Am not focused on abstraction and great written code, goal is to make stuff working,<br />
i thinking to make many shaders and pipelines just of entity properties because not all entity must use specular lighting or some bloom effect. <br />
Terrain and SkySphere is take form SaschaWillems Tutorial. <br />

For now entity has available graphics effects: <br />
Per-Pixel Lighting <br />
Specular Lighting <br />
